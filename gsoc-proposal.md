# LazyWolves GSoC 2020 proposal guidelines

Writing a good and clear proposal is extremely important for GSoC. It is through your proposal
that org admins and mentors will come to know about your ideas, your approach and how you have
decided to implement your ideas and projects.

We would recommend to provide as much details as possible in your proposal. Timeline is a must.
Students are free to chose their own format an structure for writing their proposols, as long as it
provides all the neccessary details, we are fine with it. Following are a few guidelines which we
recommend to follow and a few sections which if included in the proposal might help review your
proposal better.
