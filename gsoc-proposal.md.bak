# LazyWolves GSoC 2020 proposal guidelines

Writing a good and clear proposal is extremely important for GSoC. It is through your proposal
that org admins and mentors will come to know about your ideas, your approach and how you have
decided to implement your ideas and projects.

We would recommend to provide as much details as possible in your proposal. Timeline is a must.
Students are free to chose their own format an structure for writing their proposols, as long as it
provides all the neccessary details, we are fine with it. Following are a few guidelines which we
recommend to follow and a few sections which if included in the proposal might help review your
proposal better.

## Personal details

- Your name, email, github handle
- Country, timezone, primary language
- University

## Project proposal overview

- The project/idea you wish to work on and a bried description of your problem statement.
- Your end goal in brief.

## The proposal in details

- How you plan to implement your idea in as much details as possible.
- The technologies you want to use, why and how.
- Try to structure this part in the best way possible, create as many sections as you like.
- Mention about any blocker that you suspect you will be facing in future.
- Wireframes and sketches wherever its applicable.
- Schedule/Timeline. This is extremely important as this will help you as well as us to decide if things
  are on time.

## About your self

- Brief description about your self.
- You may include things you have worked on before, opensource contributions you have done before,
  your university project etc.
- Any other achievements you feel like mentioning.

## Why this project?

- Why did you chose this project and organisation, why do you want to work on this project.

## Are you applying to any other organisations?

## After GSoC ends

- What do you plan to do after GSoC ends, how do you want to keep yourself involved with LazyWolves?

## Your availability during summer

Apart from the above points, please do acknowledge the fact that GSoC is a three month program. So
whatever you plan to do should be roughly feasable to be done in a span of 3 months. It is perfectly fine
if some parts of the projects are left out due to time contraints, but it is expected that the student
prioritizes the different milestones properly.

Best of Luck!!
