# Welcome to LazyWolves

LazyWolves is an organization at its very early stage. The primary aim of this organisation
is to collaboratively produce softwares and tools for quicker, faster and simpler automation
and infrastructure management. 

Such tools or softwares can range from full fledged applications
to well packaged collection of scripts which can help us in our day to day development or
devops life.

Going forward LazyWolves would love to act as a platform for like minded automation, scripting
and code loving people to come together build something which can help the community as a whole.

Presently all the projects present in this organisation are at a very early stage of their development.
It would be great if people like you would spend some of your time to contribute and take these
projects to greater heights.
