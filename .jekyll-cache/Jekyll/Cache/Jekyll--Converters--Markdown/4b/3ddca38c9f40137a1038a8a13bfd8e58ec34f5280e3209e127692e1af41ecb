<p>Writing a good and clear proposal is extremely important for GSoC. It is through your proposal
that org admins and mentors will come to know about your ideas, your approach and how you have
decided to implement your ideas and projects.</p>

Students are free to chose their own format an structure for writing their proposols, as long as it
provides all the neccessary details, we are fine with it. Following are a few guidelines which we
